# Dog Breeds

Flutter Coding Challenge

I implemented the MVVM architectural pattern, utilized Dio for API calls, BloC for state management, Mockito and flutter_test for unit testing.

Implemented Functions:

Random image by breed.
Images list by breed.
Random image by breed and sub-breed.
Images list by breed and sub-breed.

How to Use:

Choose a dog breed.
Two buttons will appear: one for the breed's images and another for a random image of the breed. If the breed has sub-breeds, a dropdown menu will appear after selecting the breed, allowing you to choose a sub-breed. Two buttons will then appear for images of the breed and sub-breed, as well as a random image of the breed and sub-breed.
Press any button to display images.
